# ComfyUI-LBM

A ComfyUI implementation of Latent Bridge Matching (LBM) for efficient image relighting. This node utilizes the LBM algorithm to perform single-step image-to-image translation specifically for relighting tasks.

## Features

- Fast image relighting with a single inference step
- Simplified workflow with just one node
- Optimized memory usage
- **Automatic model download** - the model will be downloaded automatically and properly renamed on first use
- Extensible architecture - support for depth and normal map processing coming soon

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-LBM.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-LBM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download Models

The model will be automatically downloaded and renamed on first use, or you can manually download it:

| Model | Description | Link |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| LBM Relighting | Main model for image relighting | [Download](https://huggingface.co/jasperai/LBM_relighting/resolve/main/model.safetensors) |

After downloading, place the model file in your `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` directory and rename it to `LBM_relighting.safetensors`

## Basic Usage

1. Add the "LBM Relighting" node from the `üß™AILab/üîÜLBM` category
2. Connect an image source to the "LBM Relighting" node
3. Select the model file (defaults to `LBM_relighting.safetensors`)
4. Adjust the steps parameter as needed (default: 30)
5. Run the workflow

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Recommendation |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Model** | The LBM model file to use | Default is `LBM_relighting.safetensors` |
| **Steps** | Number of inference steps | Default is 30. More steps may improve quality at the cost of processing time |

## Setting Tips

| Setting | Recommendation |
| ------- | -------------- |
| **Steps** | For most images, 20-30 steps provides a good balance between quality and speed |
| **Input Resolution** | The model works best with images of 512x512 or higher resolution |
| **Memory Usage** | If you encounter memory issues, try processing images at a lower resolution |
| **Performance** | For batch processing, consider reducing steps to 15-20 for faster throughput |

## About Model

This implementation uses the Latent Bridge Matching (LBM) method from the paper "LBM: Latent Bridge Matching for Fast Image-to-Image Translation". The model is designed for fast image relighting, transforming the lighting of objects in an image.

LBM offers:
* Fast processing with a single inference step
* High-quality relighting effects
* Memory-efficient operation
* Consistent results across various image types

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of images with different lighting conditions, ensuring:
* Balanced representation across different image types
* High accuracy in various scenarios
* Robust performance with complex lighting

## Roadmap

Future plans for this repository include:
* LBM Depth - for depth map estimation
* LBM Normal - for normal map generation
* Additional optimization options
